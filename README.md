# MarsExplorerJS
This is a javascript (well typescript) version of C# program I did as an assignment 6 years back. (https://github.com/JoshiPranav/MarsExplorer)

This is an effort to get hands on with Typescript and try out the OO features it supports....

Typescript 
Gulp
Mocha
Chai
Node (to run the JS code from command prompt)
